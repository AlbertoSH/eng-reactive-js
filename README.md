# RxJS Kata

NOTE: This is a port of [Alberto Sanz's RxJava Kata](https://tools.adidas-group.com/bitbucket/users/sanzalb/repos/engineering-day-rxkata/browse) for the Engineering Day.

The contents of files, operators and frameworks used may not be the same but **it works the same**.

Make sure you have `node >= 8` installed to be able to use this repository.

## Objective

You have several scripts under `src`. They contain several functions for which implementation is missing. You need to code the implementation so that the tests pass. Each method contains the description of what you should implement.

## How to run the tests

First of all, you need to install npm dependencies

```
npm install
```

Once done, we can run `jest` with

```
npm test
```

## Useful info

There's a nice decision tree in [the documentation
of ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html)
